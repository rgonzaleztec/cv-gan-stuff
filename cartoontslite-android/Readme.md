## Goal of this tutorial
The first approach it will be use a trained model with tensorflow lite and android.

## Somo Definitions

GAN
A generative adversarial network, or GAN, is a deep neural network framework which is able to learn from a set of training data and generate new data with the same characteristics as the training data. For example, a generative adversarial network trained on photographs of human faces can generate realistic-looking faces which are entirely fictitious.

White-Box Cartoon
It is popular art form apply of diferent stuffs. It is great approach to transform imagenes of people for example and create a version in cartoon art.
A great paper about it may be it is Learning to Cartoonize Using White-box Cartoon Representations, see the paper [here](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Wang_Learning_to_Cartoonize_Using_White-Box_Cartoon_Representations_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf).
